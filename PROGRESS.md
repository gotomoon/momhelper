## 📂 File Structure

```

├── pages/
│   ├── index.astro (English homepage)

│   └── ko/
│       ├── index.astro (Korean homepage)

```

## 💡 Key Decisions

1. **Single-page bilingual approach** - Each language has its own page rather than client-side language switching
2. **Preserved WordPress URLs** - All Korean URLs match exactly for SEO
3. **Using existing components** - Leveraged AstroWind components rather than building custom ones
4. **Static-first public site** - Public pages are static; the project now uses a lightweight blog admin instead of a full CMS
5. **Netlify Forms** - Recommended for form handling (zero config)

### 5. Multilingual Language Switching System (October 12, 2025)

- ✅ Implemented intelligent language switching in BasicScripts.astro
- ✅ Added page translation mappings for all EN ↔ KO pages
- ✅ Enhanced Header.astro with data-lang-switch attributes
- ✅ Created alternative slug mappings for URL variations
- ✅ Language switcher now redirects to equivalent pages (not just homepage)

**How it works:**

- When switching from `/postpartum-care` (EN) to Korean → redirects to `/ko/산후조리-서비스`
- When switching from `/ko/이용요금-2` (KO) to English → redirects to `/pricing`
- Falls back gracefully if no mapping exists
- Supports alternative slugs and URL variations

## ⚠️ Known Issues / To Address

1. Need actual images from WordPress site (currently using placeholders)
2. Form backend needs to be configured (Netlify Forms or alternative)
3. Some old EN church pages still exist (need cleanup)
4. Blog posts not migrated yet

## 📈 Progress: ~40% Complete

According to the original plan (21 essential pages + 3 blog posts):

- **Completed:** 5 pages
- **Remaining:** 16 pages + 3 blog posts
- **Build Status:** ✅ Working
- **Visual Parity:** 🟡 In Progress (needs actual images)
