            <strong>I, too,</strong> had a difficult time with the issues and worries that came with the birth of my first child. After giving birth, I wasn't able to properly take care of myself postpartum and suffered from symptoms of 'sanhu-pung' (postpartum wind syndrome). At one point, my arms hurt so much that even light tasks were painful and inconvenient. With the advice of the elders around me, I decided that I had to be very careful with my postpartum care when I had my second child.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-700">
            To treat and recover from the aftereffects I experienced after my first child, I needed proper postpartum care. For healthy parenting, a healthy home, and a healthy social life, it was essential for me to recover completely. So, a few years later, after giving birth to my second child, I meticulously took care of myself postpartum. As a result, my body recovered, and the restored health was an indescribable surprise and a proven fact. Whenever I faced challenging tasks, I was always grateful that my arms, legs, and back were strong, and I was reminded of the positive outcomes and importance of proper postpartum care.

            Later, I underwent professional training for postpartum care and officially started my career as a postpartum caregiver. Having personally experienced the discomfort and challenges after childbirth and its aftereffects, I developed a deep affection for taking care of mothers and babies and could wholeheartedly commit to my role as a postpartum caregiver. Now, with that passion and sense of duty, I have become a valuable helper providing the best methods and support to all mothers and babies in the United States through 'postpartum care specialization, caregiver education management, and dispatch.'

            The pregnancy and birth of a precious baby are the most wondrous blessings that serve as the focal point for the development and unity of a family. I sincerely thank all the mothers and their families who have trusted, supported, and encouraged us to be a part of this blessing.
