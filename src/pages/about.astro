              <strong class="text-mh-orange-dark">I, too,</strong> had a difficult time with the issues and worries that
              came with the birth of my first child. After giving birth, I wasn't able to properly take care of myself postpartum
              and suffered from symptoms of 'sanhu-pung' (postpartum wind syndrome). At one point, my arms hurt so much that
              even light tasks were painful and inconvenient. With the advice of the elders around me, I decided that I had
              to be very careful with my postpartum care when I had my second child.
            </p>
            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              To treat and recover from the aftereffects I experienced after my first child, I needed proper postpartum
              care. For healthy parenting, a healthy home, and a healthy social life, it was essential for me to recover
              completely. So, a few years later, after giving birth to my second child, I meticulously took care of
              myself postpartum. As a result, my body recovered, and the restored health was an indescribable surprise
              and a proven fact. Whenever I faced challenging tasks, I was always grateful that my arms, legs, and back
              were strong, and I was reminded of the positive outcomes and importance of proper postpartum care.

              Later, I underwent professional training for postpartum care and officially started my career as a
              postpartum caregiver. Having personally experienced the discomfort and challenges after childbirth and its
              aftereffects, I developed a deep affection for taking care of mothers and babies and could wholeheartedly
              commit to my role as a postpartum caregiver. Now, with that passion and sense of duty, I have become a
              valuable helper providing the best methods and support to all mothers and babies in the United States
              through 'postpartum care specialization, caregiver education management, and dispatch.'

            <p class="leading-relaxed">
              The pregnancy and birth of a precious baby are the most wondrous blessings that serve as the focal point
              for the development and unity of a family. I sincerely thank all the mothers and their families who have
              trusted, supported, and encouraged us to be a part of this blessing.
