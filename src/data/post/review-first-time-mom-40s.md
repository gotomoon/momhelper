## Review from a first-time mother in her 40s

I am a relatively older first-time mother, having had my first child at 41. Since I have no family to help me with postpartum care, and my husband is often out for church duties, leaving early in the morning and returning late at night, I was in desperate need of support. Thankfully, Aunt Irene from Mom Helper USA took great care of both me and my baby, making me feel comfortable. I was able to enjoy a pleasant and healthy postpartum recovery, and I also learned a lot about childcare.

From the phone interview, I could tell that she was a kind and caring person, which gave me peace of mind in signing the contract and allowed me to await my delivery with a sense of security. Although I gave birth earlier than expected, she thankfully came on the needed date. She quickly understood the layout of our home and tirelessly helped with household chores, cooking, childcare, and managing my health.

She is an excellent cook. She prepared low-sodium meals that suited my taste, ensuring they were delicious and packed with balanced nutrients. She also provided foods that supported breastfeeding, guided me on healthy habits, and even offered massages to help with my quick recovery. She was so dedicated that she hardly took any breaks, always helping me with care.

She truly adored my baby and often spoke to the baby in a cheerful voice, making it seem like our little one recognized her. She provided clean and healthy care, and taught me how to take care of the baby on my own later. Even if my own mother had come to help, the postpartum care and newborn care she provided would have been incomparable.

I believe she is someone who excels at emotional care for mothers, especially right after childbirth when they may feel emotionally low. She never seemed tired and always maintained a positive attitude, listening to me like a good friend, offering encouragement and support. Thanks to her, I was able to enjoy a pleasant and healthy postpartum recovery. I am truly grateful to Aunt Irene, who provided the best postpartum care for me. I highly recommend her to anyone in need of warm, caring support! I miss you so much, Auntie!
