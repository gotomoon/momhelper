Early pregnancy is exciting and full of change, especially if it is your first time. Here are the most common signs to watch for and simple ways to take care of yourself.

## Common early pregnancy symptoms

### Fatigue
Your body is working hard to support a growing baby, so feeling more tired than usual is normal. Prioritize rest and short naps if you can.

### Morning sickness
Nausea or aversion to smells often shows up early. Eating small, frequent meals and sipping ginger or mint tea can help settle your stomach.

### Breast changes
Hormone shifts can make breasts feel tender or fuller. Choose supportive, comfortable bras and gentle massages to ease soreness.

### Frequent urination
Increased blood volume and a growing uterus can send you to the bathroom more often. Drink plenty of water but limit caffeine.

### Mood swings
Hormonal changes may cause fast emotional shifts. Be kind to yourself and let the people around you know you might need extra support.

### Implantation bleeding
Light spotting can occur when the fertilized egg attaches to the uterine lining. If bleeding is heavy or continues, contact your provider.

### Constipation
Hormones can slow digestion. Add fiber-rich foods and drink more water to keep things moving.

### Changes in taste and smell
You might suddenly dislike foods you used to enjoy or become sensitive to certain scents. This is common and usually fades over time.

### Back pain
As your uterus expands, your lower back can feel strained. Gentle stretching, prenatal yoga, and good posture can reduce discomfort.
