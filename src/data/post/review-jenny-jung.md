## Postpartum Care Review by Jenny Jung

Aunt Woojoo is highly knowledgeable and has a lot of experience with children. She has a warm heart, is positive, and has a bright personality. She loves and cares deeply for babies. She is a highly experienced professional whom you can trust completely. My baby was born underweight, very small, and with a severe case of jaundice, which even delayed the hospital discharge. Aunt Woojoo worked diligently to help my baby recover from jaundice quickly. She also quickly recognized the baby’s difficulty with breastfeeding due to a tongue tie and ensured that we were able to get a tongue clip procedure done promptly. Thanks to her efforts, my baby recovered from jaundice, and we successfully established breastfeeding.

With a variety of delicious meals, Aunt Woojoo made sure I, as a new mother, was well-fed and could pump and breastfeed more often. If it had just been my husband and me, with our lack of experience and knowledge, I believe our baby would have struggled to eat, and we wouldn’t have been able to achieve successful growth or bring the baby to a normal weight. When I think about how a baby who doesn’t eat enough would have likely cried or been fussy due to hunger and sleep disturbances, I am all the more grateful for Aunt Woojoo.

Above all, during the six weeks Aunt Woojoo stayed with us, she spoke to the baby and sang short songs, treating the baby as a full person. She mentioned that the baby was responding quickly to music, and as a result, my husband, who never used to sing, started singing and playing music for the baby. The massages to relieve my mastitis quickly eased my breast pain, allowing milk to flow freely, which helped me regain my peace of mind. I also enjoyed the mugwort steam sitz baths she provided and the relaxing massages for my chest, face, shoulders, arms, and back, which often put me to sleep. Even though I am a 36-year-old mother, I fully recovered from a natural delivery within a month. Thanks to her diligent feeding efforts, my baby, who was born underweight at less than 5 pounds, reached 9 pounds in less than a month.

Aunt Woojoo often captured moments of the baby that my husband and I missed, sending us texts with photos of the baby’s expressions and activities, ensuring we didn’t miss any newborn memories (photos). Everything she did was filled with love and dedication, which is why I called her Super Aunt. She also taught us many tips, and her successful sleep training made it easy for us to care for the baby even after she left. I hope that when we have our second child, our baby will remember Aunt Woojoo, who helped us so much.

I believe meeting Aunt Woojoo was truly a stroke of luck. I highly recommend Aunt Woojoo~~~
