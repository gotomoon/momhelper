## Postpartum Care Review from Yaeun’s Mom

I am a mother of four, and I had my third child after turning 40. Although I have already given birth and raised other children, I knew that the baby was not fully growing inside my body. So, I gave birth a month earlier than expected with the intention of nurturing the baby. The baby was much smaller compared to typical newborns, with little fat and low birth weight.

Aunt Woojoo met the baby for the first time, saying, ‘Oh my, the baby is so small!’ And indeed, the baby was so small that ‘as small as a palm’ was an accurate description. However, Aunt Woojoo took care of this fragile baby, who hadn’t had the chance to fully grow inside, with great care and love, feeding and nurturing the baby with dedication. My husband even bought a newborn scale from the hospital, and we had to weigh the baby once a week. To our surprise, the baby’s weight and size returned to normal, and we breathed a sigh of relief. The doctor at the hospital asked, ‘How did the baby recover so quickly?’ My husband was so happy and proud to hear that.

My husband and I were grateful and proud that Aunt Woojoo was a newborn care expert. Our other children also grew attached to her, especially our three-year-old, who had been the baby of the house until now. He would go into Aunt Woojoo’s room and lie down on her bed. When we all gathered on the nursing sofa in Aunt Woojoo’s room, with the baby and our family huddled together, she even took family snapshots for us, and also took some special photos of just me and the baby. When my legs became swollen and uncomfortable, she gave me leg and abdominal massages.

I started to enjoy food so much, especially meals I hadn’t had before, that I was worried I might gain weight. However, recovering my body was the priority, and I knew I could control my diet after a few months, so I ate comfortably. My husband, who usually worked from home but ate out frequently, became very interested in the meals Aunt Woojoo prepared, often asking, ‘What’s on the menu today?’ During Aunt Woojoo’s stay, my husband’s blood pressure significantly dropped, and his belly shrank, making him feel more comfortable and happy with how his clothes fit. He even wished Aunt Woojoo could stay longer, but since she had other commitments, after completing her scheduled 8 weeks with us, she had to move on to her next appointment.

She was completely different from anyone who had provided postpartum care for me before, in every way. After a month, I even felt comfortable enough to leave the baby and our large home in her care while going on a family trip and an unavoidable business trip. During the 8 weeks Aunt Woojoo was with us, our family felt comfortable and secure.

Meeting the right postpartum caregiver and receiving proper postpartum care seem to be very important.
Entrust your postpartum care to Aunt Woojoo, who was the best for me. I highly recommend her.
